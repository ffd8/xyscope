# Create a Library for the Processing open source programming language and 
# environment (http://processing.org/)
#
# Customize the build properties to make the ant-build-process work for your 
# environment. How? Please read the comments below.
#
# The default properties are set for OS X. Please refer to comments for Windows
# settings.


# Where is your Processing sketchbook located? 
# If you are not sure, check the sketchbook location in your Processing 
# application preferences.
# ${user.home} points the compiler to your home directory.
# For windows the default path to your sketchbook would be
# ${user.home}/My Documents/Processing (make adjustments below)

#sketchbook.location=${user.home}/My Documents/Processing
sketchbook.location=${user.home}/Documents/Processing


# Where are the jar files located that are required for compiling your Library 
# such as e.g. core.jar?
# By default the local classpath location points to folder libs inside Eclipse's
# workspace (by default found in your home directory).
# For Windows, the default path would be
# ${user.home}/Documents/workspace/libs (make adjustments below)
# For OS X,the following path will direct you into Processing's application
# package, in case you put Processing inside your Applications folder. 

classpath.local.location=lib
#classpath.local.location=/Applications/Processing_3_3_2.app/Contents/Java/core/library
#${user.home}/Documents/workspace/

# Add all jar files that are required for compiling your project to the local 
# and project classpath. Use a comma as delimiter. These jar files must be 
# inside your classpath.local.location folder.

classpath.local.include=core.jar


# Add Processing's libraries folder to the classpath.
# If you don't need to include the libraries folder to your classpath, comment 
# out the following line.

#classpath.libraries.location=${sketchbook.location}/libraries
classpath.libraries.location=

# Set the java version that should be used to compile your Library.

java.target.version=1.8


# Set the description of the Ant build.xml file.

ant.description=Processing Library Ant build file.


# Give your Library a name. The name must not contain spaces or special 
# characters.

project.name=XYscope


# The name as the user will see it. This can contain spaces and special 
# characters.

project.prettyName=XYscope


# Use 'normal' or 'fast' as value for project.compile.
# 'fast' will only compile the project into your sketchbook.
# 'normal' will compile the distribution including the javadoc-reference and all
# web-files (the compile process here takes longer).
# All files compiled with project.compile=normal are stored in the distribution 
# folder.

project.compile=normal


# Set your name and URL, used for the web page and properties file.

author.name=Ted Davis
author.url=http://www.teddavis.org


# Set the web page for your Library.
# This is NOT a direct link to where to download it.

library.url=http://teddavis.org/xyscope


# Set the category (or categories) of your Library from the following list:
#   "3D"            "Animation"     "Compilations"      "Data"          
#   "Fabrication"   "Geometry"      "GUI"               "Hardware"      
#   "I/O"           "Language"      "Math"              "Simulation"    
#   "Sound"         "Utilities"     "Typography"        "Video & Vision"
# 
# If a value other than those listed is used, your Library will listed as 
# "Other". Many categories must be comma-separated.

library.categories=Animation, Sound, Hardware


# A short sentence (or fragment) to summarize the Library's function. This will 
# be shown from inside the PDE when the Library is being installed. Avoid 
# repeating the name of your Library here. Also, avoid saying anything redundant 
# like mentioning that it's a Library. This should start with a capitalized 
# letter, and end with a period.

library.sentence= XYScope is a library for Processing to render graphics on a vector display (oscilloscope, laser) by converting them to audio.


# Additional information suitable for the Processing website. The value of
# 'sentence' always will be prepended, so you should start by writing the
# second sentence here. If your Library only works on certain operating systems,
# mention it here.

library.paragraph= This includes most primitive shapes (point, line, rect, ellipse, vertex, ...) by converting those points to waveforms (oscillators with custom wavetables) and generating audio in real time using the Minim library. Vector graphics shine on a vector display and now you can view your generative works like never before! Tested on MacOS 10.9+ / Windows / Linux (RPi!).

# The current version of your Library. 
# This number must be parsable as an int. It increments once with each release.

# The min and max revision of Processing compatible with your Library.

# You can find the revision numbers in the change log: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/processing/processing/master/build/shared/revisions.txt
# Only use maxRevision (or minRevision), when your Library is known to
